title SPA New note

note over browser:
user types note and 
clicks submit button
end note

note over browser:
the browser runs spa.js
which was retrieved from 
the server previously.

the browser executes an
event handler upon the form
submit. the event handler
calls preventDefault() to
prevent the GET request 
(default form submit process).
The event handler creates
a new note, appends it to
the notes list, rerenders
the page, and then sends
the new note to the server.
end note

note over server:

the post request
contains the new note as 
JSON-data containing
the content and the 
timestamp. The content-type
header tells the server that
the the included data is 
in the JSON format.
